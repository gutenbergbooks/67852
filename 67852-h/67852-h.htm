<p class="TN-style-1">The photographic images in the original
publication are generally of poor quality and there is little that
can be done to enhance them. The hand-drawn construction diagrams
are clearer although some descriptive text may be too small to read.
However the reader can click on any photographic image or diagram
to see a larger version. This is particularly helpful when reading
descriptive text and looking at fine detail in the construction
diagrams.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">History</span> tells us—what some of us luckier
ones heard the Wright Brothers themselves
tell—that the Wrights’ active work in aëronautics
was a result of the interest aroused by
a toy helicopter presented to them by the Reverend
Bishop Milton Wright, their father.</p>

<p>Tremendous developments have taken place
in aëronautics and aircraft are fast developing
in size, speed, and range of action. They
have revolutionized warfare, and seem to be
destined to become a most important factor in
the reconstruction that will follow the war.</p>

<p>The greater the development the truer the
fact that model aëroplanes may be instrumental
in bringing to aëronautics men who
may make valuable contributions to aëronautics.
As a matter of fact, there are already
in active life, contributing their share to the
development of aëronautics, young men who
only a few years ago competed for prizes
which the writer offered for model competition.</p>

<p>The young men who are now flying models
will live in the new age—and they have much
to give and much to receive from it.</p>

<p>Through the tremendous strides forward of
aëronautics there are wonderful possibilities
for the employment of ingenuity, genius and
skill, and business opportunities, as great as
have ever been created by progress in important
lines of human endeavor. Problems of
engineering as huge as were solved by master
builders; juridical and legal questions to be
decided as stupendously difficult as any Gladstone
would wish them; possibilities for the
development of international relations greater
than were ever conceived; problems of transportation
to be solved by the application of
aircraft, as wonderful as any economist could
wish; opportunities to gain distinction splendid
enough to satisfy the most ambitious
person.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HISTORY_OF_MODEL_AVIATION">HISTORY OF MODEL AVIATION</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Model</span> aëroplaning, as a sport, was first introduced
in America during the year of 1907.
It was then that the first model aëroplane club
in America was formed by Miss E. L. Todd,
with the assistance of Mr. Edward Durant,
now Director of the Aëro Science Club of
America. Prior to this the model aëroplane
was considered an instrument of experimentation
or, when built to resemble a full sized
machine, was used for exhibition purposes.
Noted scientists, men such as Maxim, Langley,
Eiffel and others, depended largely on models
to bring about the desired results during their
experiments. Before the Wright Brothers
brought forth and launched the first heavier
than air machine their experiments, to a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
extent, were confined to model aëroplanes.
There is little doubt but that a large majority
of aviators engaged in flying machines in different
parts of the world were at one time in
their career interested in the construction and
flying of model aircraft, and from which no
doubt they obtained their initial knowledge of
the aëroplane, in so far as the same principles
and laws apply to any aëroplane, regardless of
its size.</p>

<p>The first model aëroplane club went under
the name of the New York Model Aëro Club
and during its existence a great many of its
contests were carried on in armories. The
reason for this was because of the fact that the
greater number of the models prevalent at that
time were built along the lines of full sized
machines, and their manner of construction
was such as to interfere with the flying efficiency
of the model. Streamline construction
was something unknown to model constructors
in those days and, in consequence, crudely constructed
and heavy models were very often evidenced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
and, as a result, flights of over one
hundred feet were very seldom made. At about
the same time model enthusiasts in both England
and France were actively engaged in constructing
and flying models, but the type of
model used was of a different design from those
flown by the American modelists and as a result
of this innovation many of the early records
were held abroad. The type of model
flown by the English modelists resembled in appearance
the letter “A”, hence the term “A” type.</p>

<p>It was not long after the introduction of this
type of model in America that model aëroplaning
as a sport began to assume an aspect of
great interest. Models were constructed along
simpler lines and with a greater tendency
toward doing away with all unnecessary parts,
thus increasing the flying qualities of the
models. Flights of greater distance and duration
were the objects sought and, in their efforts
to achieve them new records were made at most
every contest, until flights of from 500 to 1000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
feet were common occurrences. By the use of
the A type model and the single stick model
which made its appearance shortly after the A
type model, American modelists succeeded in
breaking most of the world records for this
type of model which is now termed by English
modelists “flying sticks.”</p>

    <p class="noindent center small">First model aëroplane exhibition held at Boston, 1910</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p>One by one model aëroplane clubs were
formed in different parts of the country until
to-day there are in existence about twenty-five
clubs and all with memberships of from two to
eight times that of the first model aëro club.
The work which was started by the New York
Model Aëro Club is now being carried on by the
Aëro Science Club of America and its affiliated
clubs. The interest in model flying grew to
such an extent that during the year of 1915 the
Aëro Club of America decided to hold the First
National Model Aëroplane Competition for the
purpose of offering to the young men of America
an opportunity of becoming acquainted
with this new sport and its advantages. The
results of this competition were beyond expectation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Models were made capable of flying
distances and with durations that, to the
early flyers, seemed impossible. In the hand
launched contests models were flown for distances
ranging from 2000 to 2500 feet, the winning
flight being 3537 feet, and it might also
be said that the contestant who flew this model,
with a model of the same design established a
duration record of 195 seconds. As this goes
to press, information is received that the
World’s Record for distance for hand launched
models has been broken by Thomas Hall, of
Chicago, Ill., an Illinois Model Aëro Club member,
with a flight of 5337 feet. Another interesting
result of the competition was the establishing
of a world hydroaëroplane record by
a member of the Illinois Model Aëro Club with
a model of the tractor type, a four-bladed propeller
being used in connection with the model.
The flying boat which is a late advent to the
field of model flying also proved a record
breaker in this competition, having remained in
the air after rising from the surface of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
water, for a duration of 43 seconds. This
model was flown by a member of the Pacific
Northwest Model Aëro Club of Seattle, Washington.
The establishing of these records
clearly indicates the advantage of scientific designing
and construction and careful handling.</p>

<p>So satisfactory have been the results of the
First National Model Aëroplane Competition
that the Aëro Club of America has made arrangements
for holding the Second National
Model Aëroplane Competition during the
year 1916. But in the announcement of the
Second National Competition the Aëro Club of
America has made provision for the holding of
contests for mechanically driven models, in
view of the interest which is being shown by
model flyers in the construction of models
more closely resembling large machines to be
driven by compressed air, steam and gasoline
power plants. This is the outcome of a desire
on the part of model constructors to substitute
for what is now commonly known as the “flying
stick,” models more closely resembling large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
machines, which models can be more satisfactorily
flown by the use of compressed air, steam
or gasoline power plants. As in the early days,
the best flights made by models using compressed
air and steam have been made by English
flyers, the duration of the flights ranging
anywhere from 25 to 50 seconds.</p>

<p>Whether or not the American flyers will repeat
history and achieve greater results with
this type of model motive power is something
that can only be determined in the future. But
in any event the scientific mechanically driven
model will, without doubt, assume an important
position in the field of model aviation.</p>

<h3>PROPELLERS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Propellers</span> may be cut from various kinds
of wood, but the most suitable, from every
standpoint, is white pine. The advantage of
using this wood lies in the fact that the propellers
may be cut more rapidly and when cut are
lighter than those made from most other kinds
of wood. When coated with the proper kind
of varnish they are sufficiently strong for ordinary
flying. Wood selected for propellers
should be free from knots, holes and other imperfections
and it is very desirable that it
should be of perfectly straight grain.</p>

<p>A piece of such clear white pine 8″ long, 1″
wide and ³⁄₄″ thick should be selected and on
one side marked <span class="smcap">Top</span>. A tracing of the propeller
similar in design to <a href="#009">Figure 1</a>, should be
laid on this piece of wood and an imprint of the
propeller design drawn on the <span class="smcap">Top</span> side.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p>To find the center of the block two lines should be
drawn from the opposite corners, their point of
meeting being approximately in the center—near
enough for all practical purposes to insure
greater accuracy. Similar lines should be
drawn from the corners on the <span class="smcap">Bottom</span> side of
the block of wood. A hole ³⁄₃₂ of an inch in
diameter should be bored through the center
thus obtained, through which the propeller
shaft will be inserted when the propeller is
finished. The two sections of the propeller
blades drawn in diagrammatical form on the
<span class="smcap">Top</span> of the block, should be marked respectively
<span class="smcap">Blade 1</span> and <span class="smcap">Blade 2</span>, as shown in
<a href="#009">diagram 1</a>. The block is then ready for the
commencement of the actual cutting. In cutting
out the propeller, <span class="smcap">Blade 1</span> should be held in
the left hand and the knife in the other, with
the blade of the knife on the straight edge of
<span class="smcap">Blade 1</span>. The cutting should be carried out
very carefully with attention constantly paid to
<a href="#009">Fig. 2</a>, and should be stopped when the line
shown in <a href="#009">Fig. 2</a> has been reached. The semi-blade
should then be sandpapered until a small
curve is obtained by which the propeller will be
enabled to grip the air.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowe25 mt2 mb2" style="max-width: 65.5em;" id="011">

    <p class="noindent center small">Diagram 2</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p>To cut <span class="smcap">Blade 2</span>, <span class="smcap">Blade 1</span> should be held in
the left hand and <span class="smcap">Blade 2</span> cut until the line
shown in <a href="#009">Fig. 3</a> is reached, after which the
sandpapering process is carried out in the same
manner as in the case of <span class="smcap">Blade 1</span>. During all
of the foregoing operations it must be clearly
borne in mind that the <span class="smcap">Top</span> of the blank propeller
must always face upward, and the cutting
should always be done on the <span class="smcap">Straight</span> lines.
Should the straight edge be cut on one edge of
the blank propeller and the curved edge on the
other, it would result in the blades of the
finished propeller having a tendency to push in
opposite directions and in consequence no propulsion
of the model would be possible.</p>

<p>Attention should next be turned to the back
of the propeller blank on which the manner of
cutting is exactly like that suggested for the top
side, with the exception that instead of cutting
along the <span class="smcap">Straight</span> lines, the cutting is done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
along the <span class="smcap">Curved</span> lines. In this part of the
work great care is to be exercised for by the
time the necessary cutting has been done on the
back of the propeller the entire structure is very
fragile and one excessive stroke of the knife
may result in destroying the entire propeller
blade. By constantly holding the wood to the
light it is possible to determine with a reasonable
degree of accuracy the evenness of thickness.
To complete the <span class="smcap">Bottom</span> side of the propeller
the blade should be sandpapered as was
the top.</p>

<p>The method of cutting the second propeller
is exactly that used in cutting the first propeller,
only that the diagram shown in <a href="#009">Fig. 4</a> should be
used. This will result in two propellers being
made that will revolve in opposite directions in
order to produce even and balanced propulsion.
If both propellers revolved in the same direction
the effect would be to overturn the model.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowe25 mt2 mb2" style="max-width: 65.5em;" id="014">

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<p>In <a href="#009">diagram 1</a> the propellers are shown with
the straight edge as the entering or cutting
edge of the blade. Some of the model builders
prefer the curved edge as the cutting edge
(<a href="#011">diagram 2</a>). It is significant that Mr. Frank
Schober, a well known model constructor,
tested both designs on his compressed air
driven model, and while both propellers were
the same in weight, diameter and pitch, the
one having the straight edge as the cutting
edge was found one-third more efficient.</p>

<p>When the propellers have been given a light
coat of shellac they should be laid aside until
the assembling of the complete model.</p>

<p>By following the foregoing instructions a
simple and effective set of propellers will be
produced. But in order to vary the experimental
practice of the constructor various other
diagrams, <a href="#014">Nos. 3</a> and <a href="#017">4</a>, illustrating suitable
designs, are provided and can be made by applying
the above general theory and using the
diagrams herewith.</p>


<h3>WINGS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most important considerations in
the construction of a model is the making of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
wings. To obtain the greatest efficiency the
wings must be carefully designed, with due attention
to whether the model is being constructed
for speed, duration or climbing ability.
Attention should be given to streamline construction;
that is, the parts of the wing should
be so assembled that the completed wing would
offer the least possible resistance to the air, if
the best results are to be obtained.</p>

<p>For the main wing three strips of spruce,
each 30″ in length, two of them being ³⁄₁₆″ ×
¹⁄₄″ and the third ³⁄₁₆″ × ¹⁄₁₆″ are required.
To make them thoroughly streamline all edges
should be carefully rounded off and all surfaces
should be smooth. A strip of bamboo at least
20″ long, ¹⁄₂″ wide, ¹⁄₈″ thick, should be cut
into pieces, each piece to be 5 in. long. To
secure the necessary curve, ¹⁄₂″ depth, the
pieces of bamboo should be held in steam and
slowly bent in a manner closely resembling the
skids of an ordinary bobsled. When the
curvature has been obtained, care should be
exercised in cutting each piece into four longitudinal
strips, from which twelve should be
selected to be used as ribs, each to be ¹⁄₈″
wide. The bending of the bamboo preliminary
to making the ribs is done in order to secure uniformity
of curvature.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowe25 mt2 mb2" style="max-width: 65.5em;" id="017">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_b_017.jpg">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_017.jpg" alt="" />
  </a>
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noindent center small">Diagram 4</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<p>When this has been done the ribs are ready
for fastening to the sticks—entering and trailing
edges—and each must be attached an equal
distance apart. In order that the ribs may be
evenly spaced it is necessary to put a mark
every 3″ on the larger stick or entering edge
of the wing, and also on the flat stick or trailing
edge. The main beam which is of the same
dimensions as the entering edge is afterwards
fastened across the center of the wing, and does
not necessarily need to be thus marked, as it is
fastened to the ribs after the ribs have been
attached to the entering and trailing edges of
the wing frame. By holding the ribs one at a
time so that the curved edge rests upon the entering
edge where the mark indicates, as shown
in <a href="#020">diagram 5</a>, they should be fastened thereon
by means of thread and glue. The rear end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the rib must be fastened to the trailing edge
where the mark indicates, also by thread and
glue.</p>

<p>After all ribs have been thus securely fastened
to both edges of the frame the third stick,
or main beam, should be attached to the frame
on the underside, the fastening being made at
the highest point of the curve of each rib. This
main beam prevents the wing covering from
drawing in the end ribs and adds very materially
to the strength of the entire wing structure.
To cover the wings fiber paper may be
used and is a suitable material, but the best results,
from a standpoint of flying efficiency and
long service, are obtained by the use of China
silk.</p>

<p>The frame of the forward wing or elevator
is made in the same manner as is the main wing,
but it is only 12″ in span by 4″ in chord, and
is constructed without the use of a main
beam. This wing has only five ribs which are
made in the same manner as those for the rear
wing, and each is placed a distance of 3″ apart.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<p>A piece of silk measuring 2″ longer and 2″
wider than each of the wing frames should
be used in covering the wings, and this can be
held in position by the use of pins prior to the
actual sewing. The extra inch of silk on all
sides of the frame is placed around the under
side of the frame—in order that it can be made
thoroughly taut when the silk has been sewn
close to the edges of the frame. After the silk
has been sewn close to the edges the pins may be
removed and the surplus silk that hangs from
the under side of the frame may be cut off. To
make this silk airproof it should be coated with
a thin coat of shellac or varnish and the wings
should be thoroughly dry before being used.
This coating, in addition to airproofing, will assist
in making the covering perfectly taut, and
also in making the wing ready for service when
the entire model is ready to be assembled.</p>


<h3>FRAME</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> all other parts of the model are attached
to the frame in addition to its having to stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the strain of the tightly wound rubber strands
which serve as the motive power for the model,
it must be made strong. It is therefore necessary
to exercise care and judgment in making
certain that the different units that make up the
frame are rightly proportioned and are of the
proper material. Just as in the large sized
aëroplanes there are many types of bodies, so
there are many different types of frames in use
in model construction, but the standard, and
for all practical purposes the best frame, resembles
the letter A in shape, hence the name
A type. The lightness of the frame depends
entirely on the materials used and the manner
in which it is constructed.</p>

<p>Some model flyers use but a single stick for
the frame, but generally the A type frame is
preferred for the reason that it is more durable,
the wings can be more securely attached to it,
and that it is possible of developing very much
better results.</p>

<p>To construct such an A type frame 2 main
sticks to serve as frame side members are necessary
and are made from spruce. Each member
should be 36″ in length, ³⁄₈″ in depth by ¹⁄₄″ in
width. By rounding the edges and smoothing
the various surfaces with sandpaper streamline
effect will be secured and will add to the efficiency
of the machine as well as to its appearance.
When the side members are placed in A
formation the extremity of the sticks at which
they meet should be so tapered in the inner
sides that when they meet and are permanently
fastened the result will be a continuance of the
general streamline effect. The permanent
fastening of the frame side members at the
point of the A may be accomplished by using
either strong fish glue or better, a good waterproof
glue and then have the jointure reinforced
by securing a piece of ³⁄₃₂″ steel wire 3″
in length and placing the center of it at the
point of the A, afterwards bending the wire
along either outer edge of the frame side members,
putting as much pressure on the wire as
the strength of the structure will permit; after
this the reinforced jointure should have thread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
wound around it to insure even greater
strength. About ¹⁄₂″ of the wire on each side
of the point should be left clear and afterwards
turned into a loop as shown in <a href="#025">diagram 6</a>, for
the purpose of attaching the hooks that hold
the rubber strands. To hold the side members
apart at the rear end and for a propeller brace,
a piece of bamboo 10″ long, ¹⁄₈″ thick by ¹⁄₂″
in width is required and this should be fastened
to the extreme rear ends of the frame side members,
allowing the propeller brace to protrude
on either side 1¹⁄₂″ as illustrated. To put the
propeller brace in position a slot ¹⁄₂″ deep by
¹⁄₈″ wide should be cut into the rear ends of the
frame side members for the reception of the
propeller brace. After the brace has been
placed in position the outer edge should come
flush with the rear ends of the side members.
To hold the brace in place thread and glue
should be used in the same manner as described
for the point of the frame side members. Between
the point of the frame and the propeller
brace two bamboo pieces, one 9″ long and another
2¹⁄₃″ long, should be used as braces for
the general strengthening of the structure.
The longest piece should be secured across the
top of the frame about 9″ from the rear and
the shorter piece about 9″ from the point.</p>

<p>When these two braces are in position the
next matter that calls for the attention of the
constructor is the matter of getting into position
at the two outer extremities of the propeller
brace bearings for the propellers. For
this purpose two pieces of ³⁄₃₂nd inch brass
tubing, each ³⁄₄th of an inch long, should
be used, and should be fastened to the underside
of the propeller brace, at each extremity of
that brace, by the use of thread and glue.
Sometimes greater efficiency is secured by putting
these pieces of bronze tubing about ¹⁄₄″
from the end. Some model constructors make
a very neat jointure here by soldering the piece
of tubing to a strip of thin brass, which is bent
over the end of the propeller brace and bound
and glued thereon. In fastening the bronze
tubing to the propeller brace it should be so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
adjusted that it will run parallel to the side
members of the frame and will therefore offer
the least possible resistance to the shaft of the
propeller when the rubber strands have been
attached.</p>

<p>When the frame has been completed a coat
of shellac should be applied to the entire structure
to render it damp-proof.</p>


<h3>ASSEMBLING</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> proper assembling of the parts of the
model is as essential to good results as is the
designing and making. Parts, although properly
made, if improperly placed in relation to
each other will very often lead to trouble.
Therefore very great care must be exercised in
the assembling process.</p>

<p>When all the parts have been prepared and
are ready to be assembled the first thing that
should be done is to mount the propellers in
position. This must be done very carefully on
account of the fact that the propeller shafts
are easily bent and if bent the result is considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
trouble, for such a bend in the propeller
shaft will cause the propeller to revolve irregularly
with a consequent loss of thrust. Before
inserting the propeller shafts in the tubing 4
washers each ¹⁄₄″ in diameter should be cut
from hard metal, and a hole large enough for
the propeller shaft to pass through should be
bored in the center of each washer. The metal
washers should be passed over the straight ends
of the shafts which extend from the rear of
the tubing, after they have been inserted in the
tubing, and in this manner the cutting into the
hubs of the propellers which would follow is
avoided. The propellers are now to be
mounted and this is accomplished by allowing
the ends of the shafts, which extend out from
the rear of the tubing, to pass through the hole
in the hub of each propeller. In mounting the
propellers it is absolutely necessary to have the
straight edge of the propellers to face the point
or front end of the model. The propeller
shown in <a href="#009">Fig. 4 of diagram 1</a>, should be
mounted on the left side of the frame to revolve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
to the left, while the propeller shown in <a href="#009">Fig. 1</a>
should be mounted on the right side of the
frame to revolve to the right. When the propellers
have thus been mounted the one-half
inch of shafting which extends out from the
hubs of the propellers should be bent over to
grip the propeller hub and thereby prevent the
shaft from slipping during the unwinding of
the rubber strands. For the reception of the
rubber strands to provide motive power a hook
must be formed in each shaft and this can be
done by holding securely that portion of the
shaft which extends toward the point of the
model, while the end is being formed into a
hook as illustrated in <a href="#030">diagram 7</a>.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></p>

<p>Eighty-four feet of ¹⁄₈th″ flat rubber is
necessary to propel the model. This should be
strung on each side from the hooks (<a href="#030">see diagram</a>)
at the front part of the model to the propeller
shafts at the rear of the model. In this
way 14 strands of rubber will be evenly strung
on each side of the frame. To facilitate the
winding of the rubbers two double hooks made
of ³⁄₃₂″ steel wire to resemble the letter S,
as shown in <a href="#030">diagram 7</a>, should be made. One
end of this S hook should be caught on the
frame hook, while the other end is attached to
the strands of rubber, and to prevent the possible
cutting of the strands a piece of rubber
tubing is used to cover over all wire hooks that
come in contact with the rubber strands providing
propelling power.</p>

<p>The wings are mounted on the top side of the
frame members by means of rubber bands and
in placing them upon the frame it should be
noted that the entering edge of each wing must
face the point or front of the model. The
wings must be so adjusted on the frame that
they result in perfect side balance which means
that there is an even amount of surface on
either side of the model. To secure a longitudinal
balance it will be found that the entering
edge of the main wing should be placed
approximately 8″ from the propeller brace or
rear of the model, and the entering edge of the
small wing or elevator approximately 6″ from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the point. But it is only by test flying that a
true balance of the entire model can be obtained.
To give the necessary power of elevation
(or lifting ability) to make the model rise, a
small block of wood about 1″ long by ¹⁄₄″
square must be placed between the entering
edge of the small wing and the frame of the
model.</p>

<p>After the wings have been thus adjusted and
a short test flight made to perfect the flying and
elevating ability of the model, and this test
flight has been satisfactory, the model is ready
for launching under its full motive power.</p>


<h3>LAUNCHING</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preliminary trials of a model close attention
must be paid to the few structural adjustments
that will be found to be necessary
and which if not properly and quickly remedied
will result in the prevention of good flights or
even in possible wrecking of the model. Careful
designing and construction are necessary
but it is equally as important that the model
should be properly handled when it is complete
and ready for flying.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<p>The approximate idea of the balance of a
model can be secured by launching it gently into
the air. If the model dives down point first it
indicates that the main wing should be moved
a little toward the front. If it rises abruptly
the main wing should be moved slightly toward
the rear. In this way by moving the wing forward
or rearward until the model glides away
gracefully and lands flat upon the ground,
proper adjustment of the balance can be effected.
If when launching from the hand the
model should curve to the left the main wing
should be moved slightly to the left of the frame
members. And if the curve is to the right the
main wing should be moved in that direction.
This process can be continued until the model
flies in the course desired.</p>

<p>The winding of the rubber strands to get the
necessary propelling power is an important detail.
The model should be firmly held by some
one at the rear with the thumb on either side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
member, pressing down on the jointure and
with the four fingers of each hand gripping the
under side of the frame members, and in this
way holding the model steady and until the
rubber strands have been sufficiently wound.
With the hands in this position the propellers,
of course, cannot and should not revolve. The
hooks attached to the rubber strands at the
point or front of the model should be detached
from the side members and affixed to the hooks
of the winder. A winder may be made from
an ordinary egg beater as is shown in <a href="#035">diagram 8</a>.
When the hooks attached to the rubber
strands at the point of the model have been
affixed to the winder the rubbers should be
stretched four times their ordinary length
(good rubber being capable of being stretched
seven times its length) and the winding commenced,
the person winding slowly moving in
towards the model as the strands are wound.
If the ratio of the winder is 5 to 1, that is if the
rubber is twisted five times to every revolution
of the main wheel of the winder, 100 turns of
the winder will be sufficient for the first trial.
This propelling power can be increased as the
trials proceed. When the winding has been
accomplished the rubber hooks should be detached
from the winder hooks and attached to
the hooks at the front of the side members as
shown in the <a href="#030">diagram</a>.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>

<p>In preparation for launching, the model
should be held above the head, one hand holding
it at the center of the frame, the other in the
center of the propeller brace in such a way as
to prevent the propellers from revolving.
When the model is cast into the air if it is properly
adjusted it will fly straight ahead.</p>

<p>A precaution which is sometimes worthy of
attention before the launching of the model
under its full power is to test out the propellers
to find out whether or not they are properly
mounted and whether they revolve evenly and
easily. To do this the rubber strands may be
given a few turns, enough to revolve the propellers
for a brief period, while the machine is
held stationary. If the shafts have been properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
inserted in the hubs of the propellers and
have not been bent during the winding of the
rubbers, the propellers will revolve evenly and
readily. If the propellers revolve unsteadily it
indicates that there is a bend in the propeller
shafts or the propellers have not been properly
balanced. If the trouble is a bend in the shaft,
it must be removed before the model is
launched on actual flight. If the propeller
does not revolve freely the application of some
lubrication (such as vaseline) to the shaft
will eliminate this trouble. With these adjustments
made satisfactorily, the model can be
launched with the anticipation of good flying.</p>


<h3>CHASSIS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> preceding instructions and discussions
have dealt with different parts of a simple
model to be used as a hand-launched type of
model. The experience which will come as the
result of flying this type of model for a period
will undoubtedly tend toward a desire on the
part of the constructor to make his model more
nearly represent a large sized aëroplane and
will make him want to have his model rise from
the ground under its own power. Such a
model is known as an R. O. G. type, that is,
rises off the ground.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowe35 mt2 mb2" style="max-width: 65.5em;" id="038">

    <p class="noindent center small">Diagram 9</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<p>To meet this desire all
that it is necessary to do is to make a chassis,
or carriage, which can be secured to the frame
of the model, and with extra power added, will
result in a practical R. O. G. model. In constructing
such a chassis or carriage it is necessary
to bear in mind that it must be made sufficiently
strong to withstand the shock and stress
which it will be called upon to stand when the
model descends to the ground.</p>

<p>For the main struts of the chassis two pieces
of bamboo each 9″ in length are needed and
these should be bent over 1″ on one end as
shown in the <a href="#038">diagram</a>, that they may be fastened
to the under side of the frame members,
one on either side, at a point on that member
12″ from the front. Two similar pieces of
bamboo, each piece about 7″ in length, are required
to act as braces between the frame members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
and the main chassis struts. Each end of
each of the braces should be bent over in the
same direction and in the same manner as that
described for the main strut so that the fastening
to the main frame member and the main
chassis strut may be accomplished. Steam
may be used in bending the ends of the pieces
of bamboo. To make the landing chassis sufficiently
stable to withstand landing shocks a
piece of bamboo 9″ should be fastened from
either side of the main chassis struts at the
point where the chassis brace on either side
meets with main strut. The ends of this cross
brace should be bent in similar fashion to the
other braces to enable its being fastened easily
and securely.</p>

<p>Two small wheels constitute the running gear
for the front part of the chassis, for which two
pieces of ¹⁄₁₆″ steel wire each 2¹⁄₄″ long
are required. These small wires are fastened
to the bottom ends of the main struts, and to
accomplish this the wire should be bent in the
center at right angles; one leg of the angle is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
attached to the bottom end of the main strut as
shown in the <a href="#038">diagram</a>. Disks for wheels may
be cut from a bottle cork which should be ³⁄₄″
in diameter by approximately ¹⁄₄″ in thickness.
The edges should be rounded off to prevent
chipping. Before mounting the wheels on the
axles which have been provided by the wires attached
to the bottom of the main struts, a piece
of bronze tubing ³⁄₃₂″ inside diameter and
³⁄₁₆″ long should be inserted in the center of
each disk. To secure the least possible resistance
on the revolutions of the wheels, there
should be placed on the wire axles pieces of
bronze tubing similar in diameter and ¹⁄₈″ in
length on either side of the wheel (<a href="#038">see illustration</a>).
When the wheel is thus placed in position
with the pieces of bronze tubing on either
side about ¹⁄₄″ of the axle wire will extend from
the outward end of the outside piece of tubing.
This should be bent over the tubing to prevent
its falling off and at the same time hold the
wheel securely in position.</p>

<p>For the rear skid a piece of bamboo 6″ long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
is used, one end of which is curved as in a
hockey stick so that it will glide smoothly over
the ground. The other end of the rear skid
should be bent over about ¹⁄₂″ so that it can be
securely fastened to the propeller braces, as illustrated
in the <a href="#038">diagram</a>. Two 7″ pieces of
bamboo are required to act as braces for the
rear skid. Both ends of each brace strut are
bent over ¹⁄₂″ in the same direction, one end of
each strut is securely fastened to a side member
3″ from the rear and the other end of each
strut is fastened to the rear skid, at their point
of meeting as shown in <a href="#038">diagram 9</a>, the method
of attaching being the same as in the case
of the forward portion of the chassis. All
joining should be accomplished by first gluing
the braces and then binding with thread.
When completed, the rear skid should glide
along the ground in bobsled fashion, thus preventing
the propellers from hitting the ground.</p>

<p>In making such a chassis or carriage the endeavor
should be made to use, as near as possible,
the same weight of material on either side
of the model so as little interference as possible
will be made with the general balance of the
model in flight.</p>


<h3>PONTOONS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> satisfactorily developed the hand
launched model and the model rising off the
ground under its own propulsion the constructor
will next turn his mind to the question of
having his model rise under its own power from
the surface of the water in the fashion of passenger-carrying
hydros and flying boats. This
will be accomplished by the use of pontoons attached
to a specially designed chassis.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p>Three pontoons are necessary and these
should be made as light as possible. Each pontoon
should be made 6″ long, 1″ deep toward
the forward part, by ³⁄₄″ at the rear and 2″
wide. The side members of each pontoon are
made from pieces of thin white pine wood
¹⁄₃₂nd of an inch thick, slightly curved up at
the front and sloped down toward the rear.
Small niches should be made on the top and bottom
sides of the pontoons into which the cross<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
braces are inserted and glued. Further reference
to <a href="#043">diagram 10</a> will show that at the extreme
forward end of the sides a cut is made
large enough to receive a flat piece of spruce
¹⁄₁₆″ wide. Another cut of the same dimensions
is made at the extreme rear end. Still
further cuts are made on the top and bottom
sides of the pontoons, the forward cuts measuring
1¹⁄₂″ from the front and the rear cuts
1¹⁄₂″ from the rear, to join the sides of the pontoons
as illustrated in <a href="#043">diagram 10</a>. Six pieces
of ¹⁄₁₆″ flat spruce are required for the rear
pontoon, the ends of which are held in position
by glue. For the forward pontoon only 4
braces are required in so far as the ends of the
two main brace spars of the forward part of
chassis are inserted in the cuts on the top sides
of the pontoon. These brace spars measure 10
inches in length and are made from bamboo
¹⁄₈th inch in diameter, which necessitates enlargement
of the cuts on the top sides of the
forward pontoons so that the extreme ends of
the spars can be inserted in the cuts in the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
of the braces. To complete the rear pontoon
and prepare it for covering, three strips of
¹⁄₈″ bamboo are required for struts. Two of
these strips should measure 9″ in length and
should be attached to the front of the pontoon
on the inner side as shown in <a href="#043">diagram 10</a>.
Thread and glue should be used in attaching
the ends of the strips to the pontoon. To enable
fastening to the frame the upper ends of
the bamboo strips should be bent over about
¹⁄₂″. The third strip should measure 8″ in
length and is attached to the upper and lower
braces toward the front of the pontoon as
shown in the <a href="#043">diagram</a>. It is necessary that
this strip be secured in the approximate center
of the pontoon to insure a good balance. For
the purpose of securing the upper end of the
third strut to the center of the propeller brace
a piece of wire 1¹⁄₂″ long should be secured to
the upper end of the strut and looped as shown
in <a href="#043">diagram 10</a>. The three pontoons should
now be covered with fiber paper and it is necessary
to exercise care to avoid punctures. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the purpose of coating the fiber paper to render
it waterproof, a satisfactory solution can be
made by mixing banana oil with celluloid until
it has attained the desired thickness, after
which it should be applied to the covering of
the pontoons with a soft brush.</p>

<p>For the main strut of the forward portion of
the chassis two pieces of ¹⁄₈″ bamboo, each
11″ in length, are required and these should
be bent over 1″ on one end as shown in the
<a href="#043">diagram</a>, that they may be fastened to the under
side of the frame members, one on either
side at a point on that member 11″ from the
front. Two similar pieces of bamboo, each
piece 8″ in length, are required to act as braces
between the frame members and the main
chassis struts. Each end of the braces should
be bent over in the same direction and in the
same manner as that described for the main
struts so that the fastening to the main frame
member and the main chassis struts may be
accomplished. Steam or an alcohol lamp may
be used in bending the ends of the pieces of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
bamboo. To make the chassis sufficiently
stable a piece of bamboo 7¹⁄₂″ should be fastened
from either side of the main chassis struts
at the point where the chassis brace on either
side meets with the main strut. The ends of
this cross brace should be bent in similar fashion
to the other braces to enable its being
fastened easily and permanently.</p>

<p>For the accommodation of the pontoons two
strips of flat steel wire, each 4″ in length,
should be attached to the ends of the main
struts, about one inch from the bottom, the
farthest ends should be bent to grip the second
spar which joins the pontoons. Note <a href="#043">diagram 10</a>.</p>

<p>To further strengthen the chassis a strip of
flat steel wire sufficiently long enough should be
bent so that ¹⁄₂″ of the central portion can be
securely fastened to the center of the cross
brace as shown in <a href="#043">diagram 10</a>. The two
outer ends should be bent down and are fastened
to the wires which are attached to the bottom
ends of the struts. This method of attaching
the forward pontoons enables the constructor
to adjust them to any desired angle
and also detach them when not in use.</p>

<p>A model hydroaëroplane is one of the most
interesting types of models and if properly
taken care of will afford the constructor many
pleasant moments.</p>

<h3>LAUNCHING AN R. O. G. OR MODEL HYDROAËROPLANE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the method of determining the balance
of an R. O. G. or a model hydroaëroplane
is exactly the same as that of a hand launched
model, the manner of launching is somewhat
different. Instead of holding the model one
hand in the center of the frame and the other at
the rear as in the case of the hand launched
model, in launching an R. O. G. or hydro, the
model should be rested upon the ground or
water, as the case may be, with both hands
holding tightly to the propellers. Then when
about to let the model go release both propellers
instantly. If the model has sufficient power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
and it has been properly adjusted it will glide
over the surface of the ground or water for a
short distance, then rise into the air. Should
the model fail to rise into the air additional
strands of rubber should be added, after which
it should be rewound and a second attempt
made.</p>

<p>Should the model fail to respond after the addition
of extra rubber, the indications are that
something requires further adjustment. Perhaps
the pontoons need further elevation if the
model is a hydro, or if it be an R. O. G. model
the forward wing may require an increase of
elevation. In any event the model should be
carefully examined and adjustments made
where necessary, after which the model should
be tested for balance and elevation. If satisfied
with the behavior of the model after test
flights have been made, another attempt should
be made to launch the model from the ground
or water.</p>

<p>On no account try to fly the model in the
house, or see, supposing the model is of the R.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
O. G. type, if it will rise from the dining room
floor. This advice may seem unnecessary, but
it is not so, for there has been quite a number
of instances in which the above has been done,
nearly always with disastrous results, not always
to the model, more often to something of
much greater value. The smashing of windows
has often resulted from such attempts,
but generally speaking pictures are the worst
sufferers. It is equally unwise to attempt to
fly the model in a garden in which there are
numerous obstructions, such as trees and so
forth. A wrecked model is very often the result
of such experimenting. The safest way to
determine the flying ability of any model is to
take it out in an open field where its flight is
less apt to be interrupted.</p>

<h3>THE LAUDER DISTANCE AND DURATION MODEL</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> many months of experimentation Mr.
Wallace A. Lauder succeeded in producing a
model that proved to be one of his most successful
models. But a few years ago flights
of 1000 feet with a duration of 60 seconds were
considered remarkable. But so rapid has been
the development of the rubber strand driven
model that to-day it is hardly considered worth
while to measure a flight of 1000 feet, especially
in contests where models fly over 2500
feet or 3537 feet which was the distance flown
by Mr. Lauder’s model during one of the contests
of the National Model Aëroplane competition
of 1915. Mr. Lauder’s model on several
occasions made flights of over 3500 feet with a
duration in each event of over 195 seconds. It
is therefore to be remembered that this model<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
is both a distance and duration model, both
qualities being seldom found in one model.</p>

<p>Reference to the accompanying <a href="#054">drawing</a>
will give a clear idea of the constructional details.</p>

<p>The frame or fuselage consists of two side
members 40″ in length, of straight grained
spruce. At the center each member is of approximately
circular cross section, and is ¹⁄₄″ in diameter.
The members taper to about ³⁄₁₆″ at
the ends, the circular cross section being maintained
throughout. The frame is braced by a
strip of bamboo of streamline form, extending
from one side member to the other, 18″ from
the apex of the frame. The ends of this frame
are bent to run parallel to the side members of
the frame where they are secured by binding
with silk thread and gluing. Piano wire hooks
are also secured to the side members of the
frame adjacent the ends of the cross brace, and
from these hooks extend wires of steel (No. 2
music wire) which run diagonally to the rear
brace or propeller spar where they are secured.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowe25 mt2 mb2" style="max-width: 65.5em;" id="054">

  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<p>The frame is braced further by an upwardly
arched strip of bamboo, as shown in <a href="#054">diagram 11</a>,
this strip being 2¹⁄₂″ in height. At the top
of this brace are two bronze strips of No. 32
gauge brass, one above the other, one on top of
the brace and the other below.</p>

<p>Adjacent the ends of these strips of metal are
perforations through which pass bracing wires,
one of which wires runs to the front of the
frame where a hook is mounted for its reception,
and the other two wires extend to the rear
of the frame where they are secured to the propeller
brace. The propeller brace consists of
a strip of streamlined spruce 11³⁄₄″ in length,
the propellers being at an angle, thus clearance
is allowed ¹⁄₄″ wide at the center, tapering to
³⁄₁₆″ at the ends. The ends of the propeller
brace extend out one inch from the side members
of the frame, to allow room for the rubber
strands to be used as motive power. In order
to avoid slotting the ends of the side members
of the frame so that the propeller brace can be
secured therein, thin strips of bamboo are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
secured above and below the end of each side
member, by binding with silk thread and gluing,
the space between these bamboo strips being
utilized for the brace which is securely
bound and glued therein. The propeller bearings
consist of strips of very thin bronze (No.
32 gauge), about ³⁄₁₆″ in width, bent over
⁵⁄₈″ strips of German silver tubing, the tubing
being soldered to the bronze strips and the
propeller brace, which fits between the upper
and lower portions of the bronze strips, is
securely bound and glued thereto.</p>

<p>The propellers are cut from solid blocks of
pine, and are 12″ in diameter. The blade, at
its widest portion, measures 1³⁄₈″. The blades
are cut very thin, and in order to save weight,
they are not shellacked or painted.</p>

<p>The propeller shafts are of piano wire (No.
20 size) to fit the tubing used in the bearings,
pass through the propellers and are bent over
on the outer side to prevent turning. A few
small bronze washers are interposed between
the propellers and the outer ends of the tubing
to minimize friction when the propellers are revolving.
Twelve strands of rubber are used
for each propeller, the rubber being ¹⁄₈″ flat.</p>

<p>The wings are both double surfaced, and are
of the swept back type. The span of the main
wing is 28¹⁄₂″, with a chord of 6¹⁄₂″. The elevator
has a span of 15″ with a chord of 4³⁄₄″.
The main wing has eleven double ribs, these
ribs being built up on mean beams of spruce
¹⁄₁₆″ × ³⁄₁₆″, the front beam being placed 1¹⁄₄″
from the entering edge, and the second beam
being 2″ back from the front beam. The entering
and trailing edges are formed from a single
strip of thin split bamboo, all the joints being
made by binding with thin silk and gluing.</p>

<p>The elevator is constructed in like manner,
except that it only has seven ribs, and the measurements
are as above set forth. Both planes
are covered with goldbeater’s skin, sometimes
known as “Zephyr” skin, which is first glued in
place and then steamed, which tightens the
same on the plane, and given a coat of preparation
used for this purpose.</p>

<h3>THE HITTLE WORLD RECORD MODEL</h3>

<p class="noindent center small">(SINGLE TRACTOR MONOPLANE, 116 seconds
DURATION RISING FROM WATER)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hittle World record model hydroaëroplane,
designed and constructed by Mr. Lindsay
Hittle of the Illinois Model Aëro Club, is perhaps
one of the most interesting types of models
yet produced. The establishing of this record
illustrates the value of careful designing and
construction and offers to the beginner an example
which might be followed if good results
are sought. In having broken the world’s
model hydroaëroplane record with a tractor
type model Mr. Hittle accomplished a feat of
twofold importance. First, in having advanced
the possibilities of the tractor model,
and, second, in illustrating the value of scientific
construction. The previous record for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
this type of model has been but 29 seconds, just
one-fourth of the duration made by Mr. Hittle’s
model.</p>

<p>Mr. Hittle’s model shows many new and
original features not hitherto combined on any
one model. Note <a href="#061">diagram 12</a>. The model is
of extremely light weight, weighing complete
but 1.75 ounces. The floats and their attachments
have been so designed as to offer the
least possible wind resistance. In fact every
possible method was utilized in order to cut
down weight and resistance on every part of
the model. As a result of this doing away with
resistance an excellent gliding ratio of 8³⁄₄ to 1
has been obtained.</p>

<p>For the motor base of the model a single stick
of white pine ⁵⁄₆″ deep and 45″ in length is used.
On the front end the bearing for the propeller
is bound with silk thread and a waterproof glue
of the constructor’s own composition being
used to hold it secure. For the bearing a small
light weight forging somewhat in the shape of
the letter “L” is used, this being made streamline.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
At the rear end of the engine base is attached
a piano wire hook for the rubber. The
stabilizer consisting of a segment of a circle
measuring 12″ × 8″ is attached to the under
side of the engine base. The rudder measuring
3¹⁄₂″ × 3¹⁄₂″ is attached to the stabilizer at
the rear of the engine base.</p>

<p>The wing is built up of two beams of white
pine with ribs and tips of bamboo and has an
area of 215 square inches.</p>

<p>The wing which has a total span of 43″ and
a chord of 5¹⁄₈″ is built up of two beams of
white pine with ribs and tips of bamboo and
has a total area of 215 square inches. The
wing is given a small dihedral and the wing tips
are slightly upturned at the rear.</p>

<p>The trailing edge is longer than the entering
edge the ribs being placed somewhat oblique in
order to secure an even spacing. The wing is
attached to the frame by two small bamboo
clips which hold it rigidly and permit easy adjustment
and is set at an angle of about 4
degrees with the line of thrust.</p>

<p>Both the floats which take practically the whole weight
of the machine are situated directly under the
wing just far enough behind the center of
gravity to prevent the model from tipping backward.
These floats are attached to the engine
base by means of streamlined bamboo struts.
Bamboo is also used in the construction of the
float frames. A single float of triangular sections
is situated just behind the propeller. The
entire weight of the floats and their attachments
is but .23 ounces.</p>

<p>The propeller which consists of four blades
is built up of two propellers joined together at
the hubs and securely glued, the completed propeller
having a diameter of 10″ with a theoretical
pitch of 14″. The blades are fairly narrow,
tapering almost to a point at the tips.
The propeller is driven by five strands of ³⁄₁₆th″
strip rubber at about 760 r.p.m. when the
model is in flight. At the time when the model
made its record flight of 116 seconds the rubber
was given 1500 turns which is not the maximum
number of turns. At other times the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
model has flown satisfactorily with less turns
of the rubber. While in the air the model flies
very slow and stable notwithstanding its light
weight and large surface. On three occasions
the model has made durations of approximately
90 seconds which rather dispenses the possibility
of its being termed a freak.</p>

<h3>THE LA TOUR FLYING BOAT</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most notable results of the National
Model Aëroplane Competition of 1915
was the establishing of a new world’s record
for flying boats. Considering that the model
flying boat is a difficult type of model to construct
and fly, the establishing of this new
world record of 43 seconds is remarkable.
Credit for this performance is due Mr. Robert
La Tour of the Pacific Northwest Model Aëro
Club, who designed, constructed and flew the
model flying boat which is herewith described
and illustrated. <a href="#066">Diagram 13</a>.</p>

<p>The frame is made of laminated spruce 40″
in length, made of two strips glued together.
They are ³⁄₈″ × ¹⁄₈″ at the center tapering to
³⁄₁₆″ × ¹⁄₈″ at the ends. The cross braces are of
split bamboo and are fastened to the frame side
members by bringing them to a wedge at the
ends and then inserting them into slots in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
sides of the frame side members and are finally
drilled and bound to the latter. The rear brace
is of streamlined spruce ¹⁄₄″ × ¹⁄₈″; this butts
against the frame side members and is bound
to them. The propeller accommodations are
made of brass.</p>

<p>The propellers are 10″ in diameter with a 19″
pitch. These are carved from a block of
Alaska cedar 1¹⁄₄″ wide by ³⁄₄″ thick. Of
course the propellers may also be made from
white pine. To turn the propellers 15 strands
of ¹⁄₈″ flat rubber are used.</p>

<p>Bamboo about ¹⁄₁₆″ square is used to obtain
the outline of the wings. The main wing has
a span of 33″ with a chord of 5¹⁄₂″. Split bamboo
is used for the making of the 9 ribs. The
wing spar or brace is of spruce ³⁄₁₆″ × ¹⁄₈″ and is
fastened below the ribs as illustrated in <a href="#066">diagram 13</a>.
The elevator is constructed in like
manner but has a span of only 17″ × 4³⁄₄″ and
has only 5 ribs. A block ³⁄₄″ high is used for
elevation. Both wings have a camber of ¹⁄₂″
and are covered on the upper side with silk
doped with a special varnish and a few coats of
white shellac.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<p>The boat is 20″ long, 3″ in width and shaped
as shown. The slip is ¹⁄₂″ deep and is located
7″ from the bow. The rear end is brought
down steeply to avoid the drag of the water on
this point when the boat is leaving the surface
of the water. Spruce ³⁄₆₄ths of an inch thick is
used for the making of the sides, but the cross
bracing is of slightly heavier material, there being
six braces used throughout. The rear
brace is much heavier in order to withstand the
pull of the covering and to receive the ends of
the wire connections. The outriggers or balancing
pontoons are constructed of the same
material as that of the boat and are held together
by a spruce beam 18″ long, ¹⁄₂″ wide by
³⁄₁₆″ thick, streamlined. This beam is fastened
to the boat by means of three brads to permit
changing if necessary. The lower edges of the
outriggers should clear the water about ¹⁄₈″ before
the steps on the boat leave the water. The
boat and outriggers are covered with silk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
shrunk with a special solution and then coated
several times with white shellac. It is a good
plan to shellac the interior walls of the boat and
pontoons before covering to prevent them from
losing their form by becoming soft from the
influence of water in the case of a puncture.</p>

<p>The boat is connected to the frame at its
front by two steel wires, their ends being inserted
into the cross members of the boat, and
then brought up along the sides, crossed and
then bound to the frame. A similar pair of
connecting wires are used to connect the rear
end of the boat to the rear end of the frame.
A U-shaped wire is bound to the outrigger
beam and frame. A single diagonal strip of
bamboo is also fastened to the outrigger beam
with a brad, its upper end being bound to the
cross bracing of the frame, making a very solid
connection.</p>

<p>Under ideal weather conditions this model
will fly on 12 strands of rubber with the possibility
of a better duration than has been made.
But, however, with 15 strands the model will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
rise at every attempt. More rubber, however,
causes the bow of the boat to nose under and to
accommodate this increase of power the boat
should be lengthened.</p>

<h3>THE COOK NO. 42 WORLD RECORD MODEL</h3>

<p class="noindent center small">(TWIN PROPELLER HYDROAËROPLANE, 100.6
SECONDS RISING FROM WATER)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the National Model Aëroplane Competition
of 1915 held under the auspices of the
Aëro Club of America, a number of new world
records were established, one of which was for
twin propeller hydroaëroplanes. The credit
for this record is due Mr. Ellis C. Cook of the
Illinois Model Aëro Club, who succeeded in
getting his model hydroaëroplane—which by
the way is a rather difficult type of model to
operate—to rise from the water and remain in
the air for a duration of 100.6 seconds. This
model is of the common A frame design with
the floats or pontoons arranged in the familiar
fashion, two forward and one aft. The model
is fairly light, weighing, when complete, 3.33<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
ounces, ¹⁄₂ ounce of which is made up in rubber
strands for motive power. <a href="#073">Diagram 14</a>.</p>

<p>The frame is made of two sticks of white
pine for side members, each member measuring
38¹⁄₄″ in length, ⁵⁄₁₆″ in depth, by ¹⁄₈″ in width.
These are cut to taper toward the ends where
they are only ¹⁄₈″ in width by ³⁄₁₆″ in depth in the
front and rear respectively. Three “X” strips
of streamlined bamboo measuring ³⁄₁₆″ in width
by ³⁄₆₄ths of an inch in depth, are used for bracing
the frame between the front and rear and
are arranged as shown in <a href="#073">diagram 14</a>. The
propeller bearings are of small streamlined
forgings of light weight, and are bound to the
rear end of each side member first by gluing,
then binding around with thread. The front
hook is made of No. 16 piano wire and is bound
to the frame as shown in <a href="#073">diagram 14</a>. The
chassis which holds the floats or pontoons is
made of ³⁄₃₂″ bamboo bent to shape and bound
to the frame members. By the use of rubber
strands the floats are attached to the chassis;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the forward ones being attached so that angle
may be adjusted.</p>

<p>The main wing has a span of 36″ and a
chord of 5″ and is constructed of two white
pine beams each 39″ long, with bamboo wing
tips. The ribs, seven in number, are also made
of bamboo and are spaced along the edges of
the wing at a distance of 4¹⁄₂″ apart. The
“elevator” or front wing has a span of 14″ and
a chord of 3¹⁄₄″, the framework of which is
made entirely of bamboo. The entering edge
of this wing is given a slightly greater dihedral
so that the angle of incidence at the tips is
greater than at the center. By this method the
added incidence in the front wing is obtained.
By the use of rubber bands both wings are attached
to the frame.</p>

<p>The two forward floats are spaced eight inches
apart and are of the stepped type, the step
being 3¹⁄₂″ from the front and has a depth
of ¹⁄₈″. These two floats are separated by
two bamboo strips as shown in the <a href="#073">diagram</a>,
which are tied to the rounded portion of
the under carriage by small rubber bands. By
the sliding of these strips back and forth the
necessary angle of the floats may be obtained to
suit conditions. The floats are built up with
two thin pieces of white pine for sides, separated
by small pieces of wood about one-half
the size of a match in cross section. Chiffon
veiling which is used for the covering of the
wings, is also used for the covering of the
floats, after which it is covered with a special
preparation to render both the wings and the
floats air and water-tight.</p>

<p>The two ten-inch propellers with which the
model is fitted have a theoretical pitch of twelve
and one-half inches. The propellers are
carved from blanks one-half inch thick, the
blades of the completed propellers having a
maximum width of one inch at a radius of
three inches. The propeller shafts are made
from No. 16 piano wire and have small washers
for bearings. Each propeller is driven by
three strands of ¹⁄₄″ strip elastic. The rubber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
is given 1700 to 1750 turns and revolves the
propellers at 1150–1200 r.p.m., when the
model is in flight.</p>

<p>The model usually runs over the surface of
the water for a distance of from two to three
feet before it rises, after which it climbs at a
very steep angle to the necessary altitude.
The model seems, when in flight, to be slightly
overpowered but this is misleading. The rubbers
usually unwind in from 85 to 90 seconds.
On four out of six flights this model has made
a duration of between 98 and 100 seconds
which is rather unusual for a model of this
type.</p>

<h3>THE RUDY FUNK DURATION MODEL</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the many different types of duration
models that have made their appearance during
the year of 1915 perhaps the model described
herewith, constructed and flown by
Mr. Rudolph Funk, of the Aëro Science Club,
was one of the most successful. Unlike most
models the propellers of this model are bent
and not cut. This model made its appearance
during the latter part of 1915, on several occasions
having flown for over 100 seconds duration.
<a href="#078">Diagram 15</a>.</p>

<p>While retaining the important characteristics
of his standard model, slight changes have been
made. Instead of the usual wire for the construction
of the frame of the wings, bamboo is
used in its place for lightness and strength.
The wing frames are single surfaced, China<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
silk being used for covering. The “dope”
which is used to render the silk airtight is made
by dissolving celluloid in banana oil. This in
turn is applied to the silk with a soft brush.</p>

<p>The camber of the main wing is ³⁄₄″ at
the center, with a slight reduction towards
the negative tips; it also has a dihedral angle
of 2 degrees. The main beam, which is secured
to the under side of the frame for rigidness, is
of spruce 1″ by ⁵⁄₆₄″, tapering to ³⁄₄″ × ⁵⁄₆₄″.
The ribs for the main wing and small wing or
“elevator” are cut from solid pieces of bamboo
³⁄₁₆″ thick by ¹⁄₄″ wide. These pieces of bamboo
are first bent to the proper camber and are
then cut into strips each ¹⁄₁₆″ wide. The ribs
are next tapered to a V at the bottom, toward
the trailing edge, as shown in <a href="#078">diagram 15</a>, and
also toward the entering edge. To accommodate
the entering and trailing edges of the
frame, each rib is slit slightly at both ends.
Both edges of the frame are then inserted in the
slots at the ends of the ribs and bound around
with silk thread.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<p>The frame is composed of two sticks of silver
spruce 38″ in length, ⁵⁄₁₆″ × ³⁄₁₆″, tapering to
¹⁄₄″ × ⁵⁄₃₂″, held apart by a streamline bamboo
cross brace in the center. An additional brace
of bamboo is securely fastened across the frame
toward the front. The propeller brace consists
of a streamline-cut piece of bamboo 12¹⁄₂″
in length by ³⁄₈″ in width at the center, tapering
to ¹⁄₄″ toward the ends. The propeller brace
is inserted in slots cut in the rear ends of the
frame members, then bound and glued.</p>

<p>The propellers are bent from birch veneer,
the bending being done over an alcohol flame
as illustrated in <a href="#078">diagram 15</a>. But first of all
the blades are cut to shape, sandpapered and
finished before they are bent. As shown in the
drawing a slot is filed in the hub of each blade
to enable the propeller shaft to pass through
when both have been glued together. The
blades are then glued and bound together, first
by placing a piece of wire in the slots to insure
their being centered and also to prevent their
being filled with glue. After this has been done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
each propeller is given three coats of the same
dope as is used on the wings.</p>

<p>The propeller bearings are turned out of
¹⁄₃₂″ bronze tubing, the length of each bearing
being ¹⁄₂″. Steel washers are slipped over
the propeller shaft, between the bearing and
propeller to insure smooth running. The propeller
shafts are made from steel hatpins which
are heated at both ends, one end of which is
bent into a loop to receive the rubber strands,
the other end being bent around the hub of the
propeller to prevent the shaft from slipping
during the unwinding of the rubbers. Two
strips of brass, each ¹⁄₄″ × 2″, are bent around
the one-half inch bearing and soldered. The
brass strips are then glued and bound onto the
ends of the propeller brace as shown in <a href="#078">diagram 15</a>.</p>

<h3>THE ALSON H. WHEELER WORLD RECORD MODEL</h3>

<p class="noindent center small">(TWIN PUSHER BIPLANE 143 SEC. DURATION
RISING FROM THE GROUND)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the beginning of model flying very
little attention has been paid to the model biplane.
Practically all records are held by
model aëroplanes of the monoplane type.
With this fact in view, the record established
by Mr. Wheeler with his Twin Pusher Biplane
is extraordinary, in so far as it surpasses many
of the monoplane records. This model is a
very slow flyer, and has excellent gliding ability.
At the time when this model flew and
broke the world’s record, the greater portion of
the flight consisted of a beautiful glide of 86
seconds’ duration, after the power gave out,
making it possible for the model to remain in
the air for a duration of 143 seconds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>The frame consists of two I-beams, each
48″ in length, running parallel, and spaced by
cross pieces, each piece 11¹⁄₂″ long. The
bearing blocks used made it possible for the
propellers to clear by one-half inch. Two 12″
expanding pitch racing propellers are used
and these are mounted on ball bearing shafts.
The main upper plane has a span of 34″ with
a chord of 5″, the lower plane being 26″ by 5″.
The elevator consists of two planes, each measuring
14″ by 5″. Cork wheels are used, each
being one inch in diameter. For motive power
one-eighth inch flat rubber is used, this being
coated with glycerine to prevent sticking.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_MODEL_WARPLANE">A MODEL WARPLANE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> model shown in the accompanying
<a href="#084">photograph</a> was constructed by Master R.
O’Neill, of Montreal, Canada. The machine
was designed after one of the leading warplanes
now in active service abroad and in
carrying out the entire features he did not fail
to include the identification marks which are
of utmost importance in the war zone.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the model are as follows:
Length of fuselage, 23″; span of top wing,
33″; span of lower wing, 29″, both having a
chord of 7″. Motive power is derived from
two ¹⁄₈ inch square elastic strands which operate
a multiple gear to which is attached a
10″ propeller.</p>

<p>In coloring the model a dull aluminum was
selected. Complete the model weighs 12
ounces. Perhaps the most interesting feature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
of the model is the ability to change it to a
monoplane by the removal of the upper wing
after which the lower wing is raised to the
sockets in the fuselage which were especially
arranged for that particular purpose.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_SIMPLE_COMPRESSED_AIR_ENGINE">A SIMPLE COMPRESSED AIR ENGINE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the past few years model flyers in
America have shown a tendency toward the
adoption of compressed air engines for use in
connection with model aëroplanes. Hitherto,
England has been the home of the compressed
air engine, where a great deal of experimenting
has been carried on, to a considerable degree
of success. Flights of over 40 seconds have
been made with models in which compressed
air power plants were used. But, however, the
desire on the part of a large majority of model
flyers in America to build scientific models, that
is, models more closely resembling large machines,
has made it necessary to find a more
suitable means of propulsion; rubber strands
being unsatisfactory for such purposes. Many
different types of compressed air engines have
made their appearance during the past few
years, among which the two cylinder opposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
type is very favorably looked upon, because it
is perhaps one of the easiest to construct.</p>

<p>To make a simple two cylinder opposed compressed
air power plant, as illustrated in <a href="#087">Figure 1
of diagram 16</a>, it is not necessary that the
builder be in possession of a machine shop. A
file, drill, small gas blow torch and a small vise
comprise the principal tools for the making of
the engine.</p>

<p>The first things needed in the making of this
engine are cylinders. For the making of the
cylinders two fishing rod ferrules, known as
female ferrules, are required. And for the
heads of the cylinders, two male ferrules are
required. Such ferrules can be secured at
most any sporting goods store. The female
ferrules should be filed down to a length of
2″, cut down on one side a distance of ³⁄₄
of the diameter, then cut in from the end as
shown in <a href="#087">Figure 7</a>. When this has been done
the two male ferrules should be cut off a distance
of ¹⁄₈″ from the top as shown in <a href="#087">Figure
7-a</a>, to serve as heads for the cylinders.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowe25 mt2 mb2" style="max-width: 65.5em;" id="087">

  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span></p>

<p>A hole ¹⁄₈″ in diameter should be drilled in the center
of each head so as to enable the connecting of
the intake pipes. By the use of soft wire solder
the heads should be soldered into the ends of the
cylinders as shown in <a href="#087">Figure 1-d</a>.</p>

<p>The pistons should now be made; for this purpose
two additional male ferrules are required.
These should be made to operate freely within
the cylinders by twisting them in a rag which
has been saturated with oil and upon which has
been shaken fine powdered emery. When they
have been made to operate freely they should
be cut down one-half inch from the closed end
as shown in <a href="#087">Figure 5-a</a>. For the connecting
rods, 2 pieces of brass tubing, each ¹⁄₈″ in
diameter by 1¹⁄₄″ long, are required, and, as
illustrated in <a href="#087">Figure 6</a>, should be flattened out
at either end and through each end a hole ³⁄₃₂″
in diameter should be drilled. For the connecting
of the piston rods to the pistons, studs
are required, and these should be cut from a
piece of brass rod ¹⁄₄″ in diameter by ¹⁄₂″
in length. As two studs are necessary, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
for each piston, this piece should be cut in
half, after which each piece should be filed in
at one end deep enough to receive the end of
the connecting rod. Before soldering the
studs to the heads of the pistons, however,
the connecting rods should be joined to the
studs by the use of a steel pin which is passed
through the stud and connecting rod, after
which the ends of the pin are flattened, to keep
it in position as shown in <a href="#087">Figure 5-a</a>.</p>

<p>For the outside valve mechanism and also to
serve in the capacity as a bearing for the crankshaft,
a piece of brass tubing ¹⁄₄″ in diameter
by 1¹⁄₂″ long is required. Into this should be
drilled three holes, each ¹⁄₈″ in diameter, and
each ¹⁄₂″ apart as shown in <a href="#087">Figure 4</a>. Next,
for the valve shaft and also propeller accommodation,
secure a piece of ³⁄₁₆″ drill rod 2″ long.
On the left hand side of the valve shaft, as
shown in <a href="#087">Figure 3</a>, a cut ¹⁄₃₂″ deep by ¹⁄₂″ in
length is made 1″ from the end. Another cut
of the same dimensions is made on the right
side only; this cut is made at a distance of ³⁄₈″
from the stud end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<p>As shown in <a href="#087">Figure 1-f</a>, the crank throw consists
of a flat piece of steel, ³⁄₃₂″ thick, ³⁄₈″ in
length by ¹⁄₄″ in width. At each end of the
crank throw a hole ³⁄₁₆″ in diameter should be
drilled, the holes to be one-half inch apart.
Into one hole a piece of steel drill rod ³⁄₃₂″ in
diameter by ¹⁄₄″ long is soldered, to which the
connecting rods are mounted, as shown in <a href="#087">Figure
1-f</a>. Into the other hole the stud end of the
crank throw is soldered.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p>Before making the tank it is most desirable
to assemble the parts of the engine, and this
may be done by first fitting the pistons into the
cylinders as shown in <a href="#087">Figure 1-b</a>, after which
the cylinders should be lapped one over the
other and soldered as shown in <a href="#087">Figure 1-a</a>.
When this has been done a hole one-fourth of
an inch in diameter should be drilled half way
between the ends of the cylinders, and into
this hole should be soldered one end of the valve
casing shown in <a href="#087">Figure 4</a>. For the inlet pipes
as shown in <a href="#087">Figure 1-c</a> secure two pieces of
¹⁄₈″ brass tubing and after heating until soft,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
bend both to a shape similar to that shown in
<a href="#087">Figure 1-c</a>. When this has been done solder
one end to the end of the cylinder and the other
in the second hole of the valve shaft casing.
The valve shaft should now be inserted in the
valve shaft casing and the connecting rods
sprung onto the crank throw as shown in <a href="#087">Figure
1-d</a>. To loosen up the parts of the engine
which have just been assembled it should be
filled with oil and by tightly holding the crankshaft
in the jaws of a drill the engine can be
worked for a few minutes.</p>

<p>The tank is made from a sheet of brass or
copper foil 15″ long by ¹⁄₁₀₀₀″ thick. This
is made in the form of a cylinder, the edges
of which are soldered together as shown in
<a href="#087">Figure 2</a>. Sometimes this seam is riveted
every one-half inch to increase its strength,
but in most cases solder is all that is required
to hold the edges together. For the caps, or
ends, the tops of two small oil cans are used,
each can measuring 2¹⁄₂″ in diameter. To
complete the caps two discs of metal should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
soldered over the ends of the cans where formerly
the spouts were inserted, the bottoms of
the cans having been removed. The bottom
edges of the cans should be soldered to the
ends of the tank as shown in <a href="#087">Figure 2</a>. Into
one end of the completed tank a hole large
enough to receive an ordinary bicycle air valve
should be drilled. <a href="#087">Figure 2</a>. Another hole is
drilled into the other end of the tank, into which
is soldered a small gas cock to act as a valve.
<a href="#087">Figure 2</a>. This should be filed down where
necessary, to eliminate unnecessary weight.
To connect the tank with the engine, a piece of
¹⁄₈″ brass tubing 3″ long is required, the ends
of which are soldered into the holes in the valve
shaft casing nearest the cylinders, as shown in
<a href="#087">Figure 1-ee</a>. As shown in <a href="#087">Figure 1-ee</a>, a hole
¹⁄₈″ in diameter is drilled in one side of this
piece, but not through, in the end nearest the
tank. Another piece of brass tubing ¹⁄₈″ in
diameter is required to connect the tank with
the engine, one end of which is soldered to the
cock in the tank, the other in the hole in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
pipe which leads from the engine to the tank,
illustrated in <a href="#087">Figure 1-ee</a>, thus completing the
engine.</p>

<p>In conclusion it is suggested that the builder
exercise careful judgment in both the making
and assembling of the different parts of the
engine in order to avoid unnecessary trouble
and secure satisfactory results. After having
constructed an engine as has just been described,
the constructor may find it to his desire
to construct a different type of engine for experimental
purposes. The constructor therefore
may find the descriptions of satisfactory
compressed air engines in the following paragraphs
of suggestive value.</p>

a model aëroplane of monoplane type driven
by a three-cylinder rotary engine which was
constructed by Edward Willard Dart of South

<p>The engine was constructed after several
months of patient labor. Careful judgment
was exercised in the drafting of the plane and
likewise in the assembling of the engine for
it is absolutely essential that all parts be properly
fitted as to enable the engine to run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
smoothly. In designing the wings every detail
was taken into consideration to insure
good flying.</p>

<h3>THE MCMAHON COMPRESSED AIR DRIVEN MONOPLANE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the latest developments in the field
of model flying is the McMahon compressed air
driven monoplane. This model was built to
be used as either a tractor or pusher, but in view
of its ability to balance more easily as a pusher
most of the experiments have been carried out
on this machine as a pusher. The machine in
itself is simple and inexpensive to construct, the
chief portion of the expense being involved in
the making of the engine. By using the machine
as a pusher a great deal of protection is
afforded both the propeller and engine, and this
protection helps to avoid damaging the propeller
or engine, which would mean an additional
expenditure for repairs, thus minimizing
the cost of flying the model.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p>The frame has been made to accommodate
both the tank and engine, and this is done by
using two 30″ strips of spruce, each ¹⁄₄″ wide
by ³⁄₈″ deep, laid side by side, a distance of
three inches apart, up to within 10″ of the
front, as shown in the accompanying <a href="#098A">photograph</a>.
No braces are used on the frame, as
the tank, when securely fastened between the
frame, acts in that capacity.</p>

<p>The wings are made in two sections, each
section measuring 24″ in span by 8″ in chord,
consisting of two main spars, ³⁄₁₆″ in diameter,
one for the entering edge and one for the trailing
edge. To these edges, at a distance of
three inches apart, are attached bamboo ribs,
18 in all, each measuring 8″ in length by ¹⁄₈″
in width by ¹⁄₁₆″ thick. The wings are round
at the tips, and have a camber of approximately
one-half inch, but they are not set at an angle
of incidence. Light China silk is used for
covering and after being glued over the top of
the wing frame is given two coats of dope to
shrink and fill the pores of the fabric. A good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
“dope” for the purpose can be made from celluloid
dissolved in banana oil. The wing sections
are attached to the frame and braced by
light wire. The forward wing or “elevator” is
made in the same manner as the main wing, but
should measure only 18″ × 3″. Instead of being
made in two sections as the main wing, the
forward wing is made in one piece.</p>

<p>The chassis is made by forming two V struts
from strong steel wire sufficiently large enough
so that when they are attached to the frame of
the model the forward part will be 9″ above the
ground. One V strut is securely fastened to
either side of the frame, at a distance of 8″
from the front. A 7″ axle is fastened to the
ends of these struts. On the axle are mounted
two light wheels, each about 2″ in diameter.
The chassis is braced by light piano wire.</p>

<p>The rear skid is made in the same manner as
the forward skid, only that the ends of the
struts are brought together and a wheel 1 inch
in diameter is mounted at the bottom ends by
means of a short axle. The struts are not
more than 7¹⁄₂″ long, thus allowing a slight
angle to the machine when it is resting upon
the ground.</p>

<p>The machine complete does not weigh over
7 ounces. The power plant used in connection
with this model is of the two cylinder opposed
engine type, with tank such as has just been
described in the foregoing chapter.</p>

<p>The tank is mounted in the frame by drilling
a ¹⁄₁₆″ hole through either end of the tank,
through which a drill rod of this diameter can
be inserted. About ³⁄₄ths of the drill rod
should extend out on each side of the tank, to
permit the fastening of the tank to the frame
side members. This method of mounting the
tank serves two purposes to a satisfactory degree.
First, it permits secure fastening; second,
as the rods are passed through the side and
cap of the tank they help materially in preventing
the caps from being blown off in the event
of excessive pressure.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_MCMAHON_COMPRESSED_AIR_DRIVEN">THE MCMAHON COMPRESSED AIR DRIVEN
BIPLANE</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the McMahon model we find a very satisfactory
type of compressed air driven model.
On several occasions this model has made
flights of over 200 feet with a duration of between
10 and 15 seconds, and the indications
are that by the use of a more powerful engine
the model can be made to fly a greater distance,
with a corresponding increase of duration.
The engine used in connection with the model
is of the two cylinder opposed type, such as
described in the foregoing paragraphs. The
tank, however, is somewhat different in design
from that just described, it having been made
of 28 gauge sheet bronze, riveted every one-half
inch. The two long bolts that hold the
steel caps on either end of the tank also serve as
attachments for the spars that hold the tank to
the engine bed, as shown in <a href="#102">diagram 17</a>. The
tank has been satisfactorily charged to a pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
of 200 lbs. per square inch, but only a pressure
of 150 lbs. is necessary to operate the
engine. The tank measures 10″ in length by
3″ in diameter and weighs 7 ounces.</p>

<p>The wings of this machine are single surfaced
and covered with fiber paper. The top
wing measures 42″ in span by 6″ in chord.
The lower wing is 24″ by 6″. The wings have
a total surface of 396 square inches and are
built up of two ³⁄₁₆″ dowel sticks, flattened to
streamline shape. Only two sets of uprights
separate the wings, thus adding to the streamline
appearance of the machine.</p>

<p>Both tail and rudder are double surfaced and
are built entirely of bamboo for lightness,
the tail being made in the form of a half circle
measuring 12″ by 8″. Steel wire is used
on the construction of the landing chassis, the
chassis being so designed as to render it capable
of withstanding the most violent shock that it
may possibly receive in landing. The propeller
used in connection with the model is 14″ in diameter
and has an approximate pitch of 18″.</p>

<h3>THE WISE COMPRESSED AIR ENGINE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> of peculiar construction, the
Wise rotary compressed air engine offers a
very interesting design from a viewpoint of ingenuity.
This engine embodies a number of
novel features not hitherto employed in the construction
of compressed air engines, and in
view of the fact that the majority of compressed
air engines are made on the principle of
the opposed type, this engine suggests many
possibilities for the rotary type engine.</p>

<p>The engine consists of five cylinders and
weighs four ounces, including the propeller and
mounting frame. On a pressure of 15 lbs. the
engine will revolve at a speed of 1000 r.p.m.
The connecting rods are fastened to the crankshaft
by means of segments and are held by
two rings, making it possible to remove any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
piston without disturbing the others. This is
done by simply removing a nut and one ring.
The crank case is made from seamless brass
tubing, into which the cylinders are brazed.
The valve cage and cylinder heads are also
turned separately and brazed. One ring only
is used in connection with the pistons. The
cylinders have a bore of ¹¹⁄₃₂″, with a piston
stroke of ⁷⁄₁₆″. In view of the fact that pull
rods show a greater tendency to overcome centrifugal
force, they are used instead of push
rods to operate the valves. The crankshaft has
but one post, which is uncovered in turn by each
inlet pipe as the engine revolves. The “overhang”
method is used to mount this engine to
the model. With the exception of the valve
springs, the entire engine, including the mounting
frame and tank, is made of brass.</p>

<h3>THE SCHOBER-FUNK COMPRESSED AIR ENGINE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> of the most enthusiastic advocates of
the compressed air engine for use in model aëroplanes
are Messrs. Frank Schober and Rudolph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Funk, both members of the Aëro Science Club.
For a number of months both these gentlemen
have experimented with compressed air engines
of various designs, until they finally produced
what is perhaps one of the most satisfactory
rotary engines now in use, from a standpoint
of simplicity and results.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p>As can be seen from the accompanying <a href="#104B">illustration</a>,
this little engine is remarkably simple
in appearance. The engine complete, with
equipment, weighs at the most but 14 ounces.
The cylinders, three in all, are stamped from
brass shells for strength and lightness. The
pistons are made from ebony fiber. The cylinders
have a bore of ⁵⁄₈″, with a piston stroke
of ¹⁄₂″. The crank case is built up from
a small piece of brass tubing and is drilled
out for lightness. The crankshaft is hollow,
and is supported at the rear by a special bearing
which acts as a rotary valve, admitting the
intake through the crankshaft and permitting
the exhaust to escape through a specially constructed
bearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span></p>

<p>The tank is constructed of 30 gauge sheet
bronze, wire wound, and fitted at the ends with
spun brass caps. The actual weight of the
engine alone is 2¹⁄₂ ounces, the tank and fittings
weighing 11¹⁄₂ ounces, making the total weight
of the complete power plant 14 ounces.</p>


<h3>THE SCHOBER FOUR CYLINDER OPPOSED ENGINE</h3>

<p>Another interesting type of compressed air
engine that has been developed in America is
the Schober four cylinder opposed engine.
While this engine is different in appearance
from most compressed air engines, it has been
made to work satisfactorily and is consistent
with the same high class construction that is
displayed in most all of Mr. Schober’s engines.
The accompanying <a href="#107">diagram 18</a> illustrates the
method of operation of the four cylinder engine.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>

<p>The crank case is constructed from four
pieces of 24 gauge spring brass, substantially
connected in the form of a rectangle, the top
and bottom being left open. The front and
rear walls have flanges which engage the inside
of the side walls and are secured thereto by
four small screws on each side, thereby making
it an easy matter to take the crank case apart.</p>

<p>The four cylinders are made from drawn
brass shells and have a bore of ¹⁄₂″ and stroke
of ¹⁄₂″. The pistons are made of solid
red fiber. The two-throw crankshaft is
built up of steel with brass webs. The
bearings are of steel. The valves, being overhead,
are driven by a gear mounted at the end
of the crankshaft, the gear driving the valve
shaft by means of a gear on that shaft, with
which the crankshaft gear meshes. The valve
arrangement, as shown in <a href="#107">diagram 18</a>, consists
of four recesses cut into the valve shaft, two
of which allow the air to pass from the inlet
pipes, which lead into the valve chamber at the
center of same, to two of the cylinders at once,
while the other two recesses allow the exhaust
to pass from openings in the sides of the valve
chamber.</p>

<p>The cylinders are secured to the side plates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
of the crank case so that when those side plates
are removed, the cylinders are removed with
them. The pipes are detachable at their centers;
small pipes running to the heads of the
cylinders extending into the larger pipes which
run to the valve chamber. This arrangement
is shown in the end view of the engine. A 17″
propeller is used in connection with this engine.</p>

<h3>THE JOPSON 1 H. P. GASOLINE ENGINE FOR MODEL AËROPLANES</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the past few years several attempts
have been made, both in this country and
abroad, to produce a reliable gasoline engine for
model aëroplane work, but mostly without any
degree of success. The reason for this inability,
no doubt, is due to the scarcity of small
working parts sufficiently light and at the same
time reliable. The engine described herewith,
designed by Mr. W. G. Jopson, a member of the
Manchester Aëro Club, England, is one of the
few that have been made to work satisfactorily.</p>

       r.p.m., and weighs 7¹⁄₂ lbs., including gasoline tank and
       propeller. The bottom view shows the engine with propeller
       <i>in situ</i>. Courtesy <i>Flight</i>.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p>As the accompanying diagrams <a href="#112">19</a> and <a href="#115">20</a>
and <a href="#108A">photograph</a> show, the engine is of the four-cycle,
horizontal opposed type, having two cast-iron
cylinders of 1¹⁄₄″ bore and 1³⁄₈″ stroke.
Each cylinder is cast in one piece, and as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
engine is air cooled, they are cast with radiating
fins. One h.p. is developed at 1500 r.p.m.
The total weight of the engine, gasoline tank
and propeller is 7¹⁄₂ lbs. In preparing the design
of this engine, the designs of similar full-sized
aëro engines were followed as far as possible.
The pistons are similar to those used
on large aëro engines and are fitted with two
rings; the crankshaft is turned out of two inch
special bar steel, and is carried in two phosphor-bronze
bearings. There is no special
feature about the connecting rods, these being
of the standard type, but very strong and light.
To enable the two cylinders to be exactly opposite
one another, the connecting-rods are offset
in the pistons and are connected to the latter
by gudgeonpins. The aluminum crank case
is extremely simple, being cylindrical and
vertically divided. The inlet valves are automatic,
the exhaust valves being mechanically
operated; the camshaft is driven from the
main shaft by two-to-one gearing.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<p>To assist the exhaust, and also the cooling, small holes
are drilled round the cylinder in such a position
that when the piston is at the inner end of its
stroke, these holes are uncovered, thus permitting
the hot exhaust to escape, and so relieve
the amount passing through the exhaust valves.
The commutator is also driven off the camshaft,
as shown in the drawing. No distributor
is fitted to the commutator, as small ones
are somewhat troublesome and very light coils
are obtainable at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>The gasoline tank is made of copper in
streamline form, and is usually fitted to the
back of the crankcase, thus reducing the head
resistance, but if desired it can be fitted in any
other position. The action of the carburetor
can be easily seen from the drawings; it is of
the surface type and much simpler, lighter and
quite as efficient as the spray type. Specially
light and simple spark plugs are used, that
give very little trouble. The propeller used in
connection with this engine is somewhat out of
the ordinary, having been specially designed
for this engine, and patented. The propeller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
is made entirely of aluminum and has a variable
pitch, this being easily obtainable, as the
blades are graduated so that any desired pitch,
within certain limits, may be given at once.
The results of a series of tests on a 30 inch propeller
are shown on the accompanying <a href="#115">chart</a>,
and from it the thrust as certain speeds with a
certain pitch can be obtained. Taking the engine
running at 1540 r.p.m. with a pitch of 15″,
the thrust comes out at 9¹⁄₂ lbs., or more than
the weight of the engine and accessories.</p>

<h3>THE MIDGET AËRO GASOLINE ENGINE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> numerous model constructors in
America are experimenting with model gasoline
engines, the Midget Gasoline Engine, the
product of the Aëro Engine Company, Boston,
Massachusetts, is perhaps the most satisfactory
up to the present time. An engine of this
type was used by Mr. P. C. McCutchen of
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in his 8 foot Voisin
Type Biplane Model, for which he claims
a number of satisfactory flights.</p>

<p>The engine is made from the best iron, steel,
aluminum and bronze and the complete weight
including a special carburetor, spark plug and
spark coil is 2¹⁄₂ lbs. From the top of the cylinder
head to the bottom of the crank case the
engine measures 7″. It is possible to obtain
from this engine various speeds from 400 to
2700 r.p.m., at which speed it develops ¹⁄₂ h.p.
The propeller used in connection with this
engine measures 18″ in diameter and has a
13″ pitch.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STEAM_POWER_PLANTS">STEAM POWER PLANTS</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Aside</span> from the compressed air engine there
is the steam driven engine which has been used
abroad to considerable degree of success.
Owing to the difficulty in constructing and
operating a steam driven engine, very few
model flyers in America have devoted any attention
to the development of this engine as a
means of propulsion for model aëroplanes.
But irrespective of the limitations of the steam
engine a great deal of experimentation has been
carried on in England, and without doubt it will
soon be experimented with in America.</p>


<h3>H. H. GROVES STEAM POWER PLANTS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span>
one of the most successful steam power
plants to have been designed since the development
of the Langley steam driven model, is the
Groves type of steam power plant, designed by
Mr. H. H. Groves, of England. On one occasion
several flights were made with a model<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
driven by a small steam engine of the Groves
type weighing 3 lbs. The model proved itself
capable of rising from the ground under its
own power and when launched it flew a distance
of 450 feet. This is not a long flight when
compared with the flight made by Prof. Langley’s
steam driven model on November 28,
1896, of three-quarters of a mile in 1 minute
and 45 seconds, but the size of the models and
also that Mr. Groves’ model only made a duration
of 30 seconds, must be considered. The
model was loaded 12 ounces to the square foot
and had a soaring velocity of some 20 m.p.h.
The total weight of the power plant was 1¹⁄₂
lbs. Propeller thrust 10 to 12 ounces. The
total weight of the model was 48 ounces. The
type of steam plant used in connection with this
model was of the flash boiler, pressure fed type,
with benzoline for fuel.</p>

<p>Mr. Groves has done considerable experimenting
with the steam driven type power
plant. Many of the designs used in the construction
of steam plants for models are taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
from his designs. A Groves steam power
plant is employed in one of Mr. V. E. Johnson’s
(Model Editor of <i>Flight</i>) model hydroaëroplanes,
the first power-driven, or “mechanically
driven” model hydroaëroplane (so far as can
be learned) to rise from the surface of the
water under its own power. This model has a
total weight of 3 lbs. 4 ounces.</p>


<h3>G. HARRIS’S STEAM ENGINE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> advocate of the steam driven type
model is Mr. G. Harris, also of England. Several
good flights were made by Mr. Harris
with his pusher type monoplane equipped with
a steam driven engine. As a result of his experiments
he concluded that mushroom valves
with a lift of ¹⁄₆₄ part of an inch were best,
used in connection with the pump, and at least
12 feet of steel tubing should be used for boiler
coils. The first power plant constructed by
Mr. Harris contained a boiler coil 8 feet long,
but after he had replaced this coil with one 12
feet long, irrespective of the fact that the extra
length of tube weighed a couple of ounces, the
thrust was increased by nearly a half pound.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>

<p>The principal parts used in Mr. Harris’s steam
power plant was an engine of the H. H. Groves
type, twin cylinder, ⁷⁄₈″ bore with a piston
stroke of ¹⁄₂″. The boiler was made from 12″
of ³⁄₁₆″ × 20″ G. steel tubing, weighing 10.5
ounces. The blow lamp consisted of a steel
tube, ⁵⁄₃₂″ × 22″ G. wound round a carbide
carrier for a nozzle. The tank was made
of brass ⁵⁄₁₀₀₀″ thick. The pump, ⁷⁄₃₂″ bore,
stroke variable to ¹⁄₂″, fitted with two non-return
valves (mushroom type) and was geared
down from the engine 4.5 to 1.</p>


<h3>PROFESSOR LANGLEY’S STEAM ENGINE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Langley steam driven model, of which
so much has been said, and which on one occasion
flew a distance of one-half mile in 90 seconds,
had a total weight of 30 lbs., the engine
and generating plant constituting one-quarter
of this weight. The weight of the complete
plant worked out to 7 lbs. per h.p. The engine
developed from 1 to 1¹⁄₂ h.p. A flash type
boiler was used, with a steam pressure of from
150 to 200 lbs., the coils having been made of
copper. A modified naphtha blow-torch, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
as is used by plumbers, was used to eject a blast
or flame about 2000 Fahrenheit through the
center of this coil. A pump was used for circulation
purposes. With the best mechanical
assistance that could be obtained at that date,
it took Professor Langley one year to construct
the model.</p>


<h3>FRENCH EXPERIMENTS WITH STEAM POWER PLANTS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> ten months after Langley’s results,
some experiments were carried out by the
French at Carquenez, near Toulon. The
model used for the experiments weighed in
total 70 lbs., the engine developing more than
1 h.p. As in the Langley case, twin propellers
were used, but instead of being mounted side by
side, they were mounted one in front and the
other behind. The result of these experiments
compared very poorly with Langley’s. A
flight of only 462 feet was made, with a duration
of a few seconds. The maximum velocity
is stated to have been 40 m.p.h. The span of
this model was a little more than 6 meters, or
about 19 feet, with a surface of more than 8
square meters, or about 80 square feet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CARBONIC_GAS_ENGINE">CARBONIC GAS ENGINE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> six-cylinder carbonic gas engine described
herewith is the product of Mr. Henry
Rompel, Kansas City, Missouri.</p>

<p>This is perhaps one of the most interesting
of its kind to have been developed during 1916,
and its appearance in the model aëroplane
field adds weight to the claim that mechanical
engines will soon replace the rubber strand as
motive power for model aëroplanes.</p>

<p>Mr. Rompel’s engine is of rotary, carbonic
gas type, having six cylinders, a bore of ⁵⁄₈″
and a stroke of ³⁄₄″.</p>

<p>The intake is derived through a rotary valve
which also acts as a crank shaft bearing, thereby
saving weight.</p>

<p>The exhaust is accomplished by mechanically
operated valves situated in the heads of the
cylinders being opened by the aid of rocker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
arms and push rods, which gain their timing
from a cam placed on the crankshaft.</p>

<p>To save weight in construction the crankshaft,
connecting rods, pistons and cylinders
were made of telescopic tubing with a side wall
of one thirty-second of an inch or less in thickness.</p>

<p>The engine has a swing of 5¹⁄₂″ over all,
weighs a little less than 8 ounces complete,
and is operated on 1,500 pounds pressure (carbonic
gas) and at a speed of 3,500 to 3,700
r.p.m. will develop about 1 horse power.
While spinning a 17″ propeller with a pitch
of 20 inches it will deliver a thrust of 21
ounces, and has a duration of 40 seconds.
Two hundred and fifty-six pieces were embodied
in its construction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_FORMATION_OF_MODEL">THE FORMATION OF MODEL
CLUBS</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> form a model aëroplane club at least six
interested persons are necessary. As soon as
a place in which to hold meetings has been
decided upon the club should proceed to elect
a director whose duty should be to manage the
affairs of the club. One of the first things to
be considered is the name under which the
club will operate; the custom is usually to adopt
the name of the town or city in which the club
is located, viz.: Concord Model Aëro Club,
Concord, Massachusetts, although it is the
privilege of the majority of the members to
choose a name such as they might feel will best
benefit the purpose for which the club was organized.
As in the case of the Aëro Science
Club of America, this club was formed for the
purpose of stimulating interest in model<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
aëronautics and to help those who might become
interested therein, not only in New York City
but throughout the entire United States.</p>

<p>When the matter of name and place has
been settled the club should decide upon the
course it is to follow, first by electing <span class="smcap">officers</span>
and second by preparing a <span class="smcap">constitution
and by-laws</span>. In the case of clubs whose
membership does not comprise more than six
members, it does not seem desirable to have
more than one officer, namely, a <span class="smcap">director</span>,
who might perform the duties of a president,
treasurer and secretary until the club has
reached a larger membership. In this way
the members are enabled to concentrate upon
the construction and flying of models and to
engage in such other activities as to carry out
the purpose for which the club was organized.
However, the foregoing is merely a suggestion
on the part of the writer, who by the way is a
member of the Aëro Science Club of America
and formerly acted in the capacity of secretary
to that club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<p>Clubs whose membership totals more than
twelve, however, should proceed to elect a President,
Treasurer and Secretary, all of whom
must receive a vote of at least two-thirds of
the membership. With clubs of this size a
director is not needed as the affairs of the club
are usually entrusted with the governing officers,
the President, Treasurer and Secretary.
In as much as the constitution and by-laws are
an important factor in the affairs of any
model club, the governing officers, before mentioned,
should hold a private meeting at the
earliest moment whereat to frame a constitution
and set of by-laws embodying the purposes
and policy of the club. When the proposed
constitution and by-laws are completed
they should be presented to the members for
approval after which a copy should be given
to every member.</p>

<p>The following is a specimen of constitution
and by-laws that might be used by any person
or persons desiring to form a Model Aëro
Club:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span></p>


<p class="noindent center p2">CONSTITUTION AND BY-LAWS OF A MODEL AËROPLANE CLUB</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article 1. Name.</span> The name of this
club will be known as The .......... Model
Aëro Club.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Purpose.</span> The object of this club shall be
to study and increase the interest in the science
of aëronautics in every way possible and to
realize this object, shall construct and fly model
aëroplanes, gliders and man carrying machines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Further</span>, Contests shall be held for model
aëroplanes and prizes awarded to the winners
thereof. And as a further step in the advancement
of this art, meetings, lectures,
discussions, debates and exhibitions will be
held.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article 2. Membership.</span> Any person
may become a member of this club provided
his application receives the unanimous approval
of the majority of members, or is passed
upon by the membership committee. A member<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
may resign his membership by written communication
to the secretary who shall present
it to the membership committee to be passed
upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article 3. Officers.</span> The officers of this
organization shall be a President, Vice-president,
Secretary and Treasurer and a board of
governors to consist of said officers. The
president and vice-president shall constitute
the executive committee of the board of governors,
with full powers to act for them in the
affairs of the club. The election of officers
shall take place at the first meeting held during
the month of .......... of each year and
shall hold office for one year. In the event
of a vacancy in the office of the President the
Vice-president or next highest officer present
shall preside. Any other vacancy shall be filled
by an officer temporarily appointed by the President.
The President shall preside at all meetings
of the club and of the board of governors,
and shall perform such other duties as usually
pertain to that office. The President shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
have full authority to appoint committees or
boards as may be necessary to further the interests
of the club.</p>

<p>The Secretary shall keep a record of all
meetings of the club, board of governors and
committees and shall use the seal of the club
as may be directed by the executive committee.
Further, he shall issue notices to officers
and members of all special meetings and perform
such other duties as may be assigned him
by the constitution, by the club or by the board
of governors.</p>

<p>The Treasurer shall have charge of the
funds of the club, receive all moneys, fees, dues,
etc.; pay all bills approved by the board of governors,
and preserve all proper vouchers for
such disbursements.</p>


<p class="noindent center small p2">RULES FOR CONTESTS</p>

<p>We now come to the matter of contests. As
there are many different types of models so
must there be rules to correspond to avoid misunderstandings,
and until the club has reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the stage where it may decide upon a particular
set of rules under which its members
should participate perhaps the following set
of rules, applicable to contests for hand
launched models, can be adopted. In so far
as there are different rules for different contests,
namely, hand launched, R. O. G. and
R. O. W. and mechanical driven, the following
rules are used only in connection with contests
for hand launched models; rules for other contests
follow:</p>


<p class="noindent center small p2">RULES</p>

<p>A contest to be official must have at least five
contestants.</p>

<p>Each contestant must abide by the rules of
the contest and decision of the judges.</p>

<p>Each contestant must register his name, age,
and address before the event.</p>

<p>Each contestant must enter and fly models
made by himself only.</p>

<p>Trials to start from a given point indicated
by the starter of the trials, and distance to be
measured in a straight line from the starting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
point to where the model first touches the
ground, regardless of the curves or circles it
may have made. Each contestant must have
his models marked with his name and number
of his models (1, 2, 3, etc.), and each model
will be entitled to three official trials. Contestant
has the privilege of changing the planes
and propellers as he may see fit, everything
to be of his own construction, but only three
frames can be used in any contest. If in the
opinion of the board of judges there are too
many entries to give each one nine flights in
the length of time fixed, the judges have the
power to change that part of rule No. 6 to the
following:</p>

<p>“Six flights or less, as circumstances may
require, will be allowed to each contestant,
which can be made with one model or any one
of three entered; all of his own construction;
due notice must be given to each contestant of
the change.”</p>

<p>No trial is considered as official unless the
model flies over 100 feet from the starting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
point. (The qualifying distance can be
changed by agreement between the club and
the starter provided the entrants are notified.)
Should the rubber become detached from the
model, or the propeller drop off during the
trial, the trial is counted as official, provided
the model has covered the qualifying distance.
No matter what may happen to the model after
it has covered the qualifying distance the flight
is official. Contests should cover a period of
three hours, unless otherwise agreed.</p>

<p>No contestant shall use the model of another
contestant, although the former may have
made it himself.</p>

<p>The officials should be: a starter, measurer,
judge and scorer; also three or four guards to
keep starting point and course clear. The
first three officials shall, as board of judges,
decide all questions and disputes. A space 25
feet square (with stakes and ropes) should be
measured off for officials and contestants, together
with an assistant for each contestant.
All others must be kept out by the guards and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
space kept clear (at least 25 feet) in front of
the starting point, so a contestant will not be
impeded in making his trial.</p>

<p>Each official should wear a badge, ribbon or
arm band designating his office, and must be
upheld in his duties.</p>


<p class="noindent center small p2">HANDICAPS</p>

<p>At the discretion of the club there may be
imposed a handicap for club events as follows:
A contestant in order to win must exceed his
last record with which he won a prize.</p>


<p class="noindent center small p2">COMBINATION AND DURATION EVENTS</p>

<p>First, second and third records to count.
Lowest number of points to win. For example:</p>

<p>A may have 1st in distance and 2nd in duration,
3 total points.</p>

<p>B may have 3rd in distance and 1st in duration,
4 total points.</p>

<p>C may have 2nd in distance and 3rd in duration,
5 total points.</p>

<p>Accordingly A wins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span></p>


<p class="noindent center small p2">R. O. G. CONTESTS</p>

<p class="noindent center">(Rising from the Ground)</p>

<p>Models to be set on the ground and allowed
to start off without any effort on the part of
the contestant. Models should rise from the
ground before reaching a predetermined mark,
no flight to be considered unless it does so.
Contestant may start at any length back from
the mark, but the distance is to be measured
only from the mark.</p>


<p class="noindent center small p2">MECHANICALLY DRIVEN MODEL CONTESTS</p>

<p>For duration, or distance, contests for mechanically
driven models might be held under
the same ruling that applies to R. O. G. models.
But owing to the many types of engines used
in mechanically driven models, definite rules
for the holding of such a contest must be left
to the discretion of the club or contestants.</p>


<p class="noindent center small p2">EVENTS OPEN TO ALL</p>

<p>These events are open to all, with no handicaps
to be imposed on either club members or
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span></p>


<p class="noindent center small p2">INTER-CLUB MODEL AËROPLANE TOURNAMENTS</p>

<p class="noindent center">(Prizes to be determined by contesting clubs)</p>

<p>The tournament to consist of five events as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Duration: Models launched from hand.</p>

<p>Distance: Models launched from hand.</p>

<p>Duration: Models launched from ground.
R. O. G.</p>

<p>Distance: Models launched from ground.
R. O. G.</p>

<p>Duration: Models launched from water.
R. O. W.</p>
</div>

<p>Dates for inter-club contest should be arranged
for at least three weeks prior to date
of first contest, to allow ample time for the
construction of special models and elimination
trials.</p>

<p>In event of inclement weather the contest
to take place the week following (each contest
following to be set one week ahead), or at any
time that may be determined by a committee
appointed by the contesting clubs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<p>Each competing club must be represented by
a team of three contestants and one non-competitor,
who will act as judge in conjunction
with the judges from the other clubs, and
a manager selected by the judges who will
supervise over the entire tournament and issue
calls for meetings. (Substitutes should
also be selected for any possible vacancy.)</p>

<p>Meetings of the judges of the competing
clubs should be held at some designated place,
at which time dates and general details shall
be arranged, and between events there should
be a meeting called, for general discussion regarding
the recent event, receive protests and
suggestions and to announce officially the result
of the contest.</p>

<p>The manager shall have control of the various
events, assisted by the judges and they
shall decide all disputes that may arise, and
act as scorers and timers, as well.</p>

<p>Each flyer will be allowed but one model
and shall be entitled to three official flights, but
he shall be permitted to make any repairs or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
replace any broken parts. No contestant shall
be privileged to fly a model not of his own construction.
Each event shall close when all the
contestants have made three official flights, or
when three hours’ time has elapsed.</p>
